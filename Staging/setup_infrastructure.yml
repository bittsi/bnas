#
# This playbook is used to setup the staging service.
#
# Files in service_vars will be created. The static infrastructure parameters are stored in infrastructure_vars and are used
# to create the service_vars.
#
# For demo purposes the files will be saved in cleartext.
# You can leave the username and password as defaults and overwrite them with extra-vars when running the playbook "staging.yml".
#
# Dependencies:
# To configure the devices, this playbook must have been run before the playbook "staging.yml".
